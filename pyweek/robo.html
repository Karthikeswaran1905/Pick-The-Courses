        <h4 style="color: darkturquoise; background-color: black;margin-top: 3px;">  Learn about the robotics engineering field and what it takes to become a robotics engineer, 
          including the required skills, education, experience, and potential salaries.</h4>
        
        <h4 style="background-color: red; color:white;margin-top: 5px;"> What skills are required for robotics engineers?</h4>
         <p style="margin-left: 10px;"><embed> As robotics engineering is a cutting-edge, multidisciplinary field, you may need to be curious and committed to continuous learning. More specifically,
         you may want to have these skills:</embed></p>
        
        <br><p><strong> Interest in how things work: </strong> As a robotics engineer, you'll be responsible for designing, assembling, testing, and maintaining robots.
         You need to understand mechanics, electronics, sensory feedback systems, and how these complex machines operate.<br> 
        
         <br><strong>Imagination: </strong> You must be able to visualize how a robot will move and interact with its environment.<br>
        
         <br><strong>  Decision-making skills: </strong> Many problems don't have clear solutions. In these situations, it's up to you to 
        evaluate different options and make the best decision.<br>
        
        <br><strong> Math skills:</strong> As a robotics engineer, you’ll use advanced math on a daily basis as you design and analyze the 
        performance of robots.<em> Algebra, geometry, measurement, and statistics </em> are commonly used, and calculus or trigonometry may also be used.<br>
        
        <br><strong> Computer skills: </strong> Robotics engineers use computer software to create detailed designs of robots and robotic systems
         before they're built. They also use specialized software programs to test how robots perform in different environments.<br>
        
        <br><strong>  A practical focus: </strong> You need to use practical and logical thinking to debug machines and get them working properly. You’ll often have 
        to make decisions that compromise performance in one area and be able to ascertain the best path forward.<br>
        
        <br><strong> Communication skills: </strong> The ability to clearly communicate your designs to other professionals is essential when you’re working as an engineer.<br>
        </p>
        <h5> You’ll also need domain-specific skills.</h5>
        
        <br><h1 style="background-color: black;color: white;"> Salary and career outlook for robotic engineers </h1>
