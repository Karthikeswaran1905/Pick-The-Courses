            <strong> What does an ECE engineer do? </strong><br>
            <div class="moststd">
         <strong> Electronics and communication engineering (ECE) </strong> is a discipline of engineering that involves developing and testing electronic circuits and communication devices 
           like transmitters, receivers and integrated circuits. </div><br><br>
        <div class="imgleft"> 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ECE typically refers to </strong>Electrical and Computer Engineering, which is a field of engineering that deals with the study and application of electricity, 
        electronics, and computing. It encompasses a broad range of topics including circuit design, digital systems, communication systems,
         power systems, control systems, and signal processing.</li>
        <br><br>
          <li><strong>Electrical engineering </strong> focuses on the generation, transmission, and utilization of electrical power, 
        as well as the design and implementation of electrical systems and devices. It covers areas such as power generation and distribution, 
        electric motors and generators, transformers, and power electronics.</li>
        <br>
          <li><strong> Computer engineering,</strong>on the other hand, deals with the design and development of computer systems and their components.
        It includes topics such as digital logic design, computer architecture, computer networks, embedded systems, and software engineering.
        <br><br></li>
          <li> <strong> ECE </strong> combines elements of both electrical and computer engineering  to provide a comprehensive understanding of hardware and software systems.
         Professionals in this field often work on the design and development of various electronic devices, communication systems, computer hardware, 
         and software applications.</li>
        <br>
          <li><strong> ECE </strong> is a rapidly evolving field with advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), wireless communication, 
        robotics, and renewable energy. It offers diverse career opportunities in industries such as telecommunications, electronics manufacturing, aerospace, 
        automotive, and information technology.</li>
